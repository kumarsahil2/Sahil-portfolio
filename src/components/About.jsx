              Hi. I'm Kumar Sahil, Nice to meet you. Please take a look around.

              I am currently pursuing a Master of Computer Application (MCA)
              with a strong passion for web development. Throughout my academic
              journey, I have immersed myself in creating dynamic and responsive
              web applications, building a solid foundation in Full Stack
              Development. <br />
              I am passionate about building excellent software that improves
              the lives of those around me. I specialize in creating software
              for clients ranging from individuals and small-businesses all the
              way to large enterprise corporations. <br />
              In addition to my coursework, I have actively engaged in numerous
              web development projects, honing my skills in both front-end and
              backend technologies.
